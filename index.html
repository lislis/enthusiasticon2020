      # Video games are amazing!

      --

      - Fostering empathy through experiences

      --

      - Fun to play _and_ fun to build!

      # What breaks the immersivenes?

      --

      Interaction happens through interfaces that are removed from the experience

      ## Only one solution:

      # Let's build our own interfaces!

      # How do I get started?

      ---

      # Let's break it down

      --

      - Have a game idea

      --

      - Have an idea for an interface / controller

      --

      - Build that controller

      --

      - Have the controller talk to your game engine / creative coding environment

      ---

      # Let's break it down

      - ~~Have a game idea~~

      - Have an idea for an interface / controller

      - Build that controller

      - Have the controller talk to your game engine / creative coding environment

      ---

      # Have an idea for a controller

      --

      - Try to be as close to the 'real' interaction as possible

      --

      - Try to repurpose something that is unrelated to theinteraction

      --

      - Try something you just want to try (and build a game around that)

      ---

      # Build that controller

      --

      - Midi controllers

      --

      - Microcontrollers

        - Makey Makey

        - Arduino (-like)

      ---

      ## Midi

      --

      - Protocol and hardware plug

      --

      - Lots of cool hardware controllers

      --

      - Plugins for popular software ([Processing](http://www.smallbutdigital.com/projects/themidibus/), [Unity3D](https://github.com/keijiro/MidiJack), [webMidi](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/03/web-midi-api/) etc)

      ## [SWAJ](https://github.com/lislis/swaj)

      ---

      ## Microcontrollers

      --

      - Endless possibilities

      --

      - Learn about electronics

      ---

      ## Makey Makey

      --

      - Easing into electronics

      --

      - Close the circuit

      --

      - Registers itself as keyboard / mouse

      ---

      ## [High-5 Romance Race](https://ratking.itch.io/high-5-romance-race)

      ---

      ## Advanced microcontrollers

      --

      - Arduino Leonardo / Micro / Due

      --

      - Also register as keyboard

      --

      - Use all sensors and modules from the Arduino world

      ---

      ### More microcontrollers

      - Other Arduinos ( Uno / Nano ) or any other board

      - Learn a bit about serial communication protocols

      ---

      ## UART

      - Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter no clock - baud
      - rate!  two devices -> otherwise bus contention Its own piece
      - of circuitry on your board can be emulated with software (eg
      - when you don't have enough)

      ---

      ## SPI

      - Serial Peripheral Interface synchronous (synced clocks!)  lots
      - of wires, one (master) to many (slaves) Used with sensors and
      - modules that talk to your microcontroller

      ---

      ### I2C

      - Inter-integrated circuit synchronous (synced clocks!)
      - communication on short distance (on one board) fixes
      - short-commings of UART and SPI multiple masters and slaves, 2
      - wires

      ---

      Make a game!  Make a controller!  Have fun and learn!
