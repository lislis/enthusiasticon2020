      # Video games are amazing!

      - Best medium for fostering empathy through creating and directing experiences
      - Also they're fun to play and fun to build!

      ---

      # What breaking the immersivenes?

      - Video games are software, and we usually intereact with software through hardware interfaces like keyboards and mouse, touch or game controllers

      - often, that's not part of the experience that we want the player to have

      ---

      # Only one solution, let's build our own interfaces!

      ---

      # #altctrl

      at GDC [2017](), [2019]()

      or at Alt Ctrl Game Jam ([website](), [on the birdsite]())

      ---

      # Lots to chose from!

      - SWAJ

      - Fishing for compliments

      - Pigarus

      ---

      # Let's break it down

      - have a game idea

      - have an idea for an interface / controller

      - build that controller

      - have the controller talk to your computer / game engine / creative coding environment

      ---

      ## Have a controller idea

      - try to be as close to the 'real' interaction as possible

      - try to repurpose something that is unrelated

      - try something you just want to try

      ---

      ## Build that controller

      - Midi controllers

      - Microcontroller

      ---

      ## Midi

      - Protocol and Hardware plug

      ---

      ## Microcontrollers

      - integrated circuits

      -

      ---

      ### GEtting started

      - Beginner: Makey Makey

      - Registers itself as keyboard / mouse

      - Close the circuit

      ---

      ### Advanced

      - Arduino Leonardo / Micro

      - also register as keyboard

      - Use all sensors and modules from the Arduino world

      - Code your own logic

      ---

      ### More advanced

      - Other Arduinos ( uno / nano ) or any other board

      - Learn a bit about serial communication protocols

      - board needs usb to serial adapter?

      - UART, SPI, I2C

      ---

      ## UART

      - Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter no clock - baud
      - rate!  two devices -> otherwise bus contention Its own piece
      - of circuitry on your board can be emulated with software (eg
      - when you don't have enough)

      ---

      ## SPI

      - Serial Peripheral Interface synchronous (synced clocks!)  lots
      - of wires, one (master) to many (slaves) Used with sensors and
      - modules that talk to your microcontroller

      ---

      ### I2C

      - Inter-integrated circuit synchronous (synced clocks!)
      - communication on short distance (on one board) fixes
      - short-commings of UART and SPI multiple masters and slaves, 2
      - wires

      ---

      Make a game!  Make a controller!  Have fun and learn!
